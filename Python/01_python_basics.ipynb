    "- Edit and execute Python code in a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- Write `print` statements in Python which print text\n",

    "Read the tutorial on Jupyter notebooks [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).  Only the material before the \"Example Analysis\" section will be needed.  This tutorial runs through how to install Jupyter notebooks, and some basics about working with code in it.  For our purposes, you will only ever need to work with code (Python) cells, though I will use markdown cells for instructions (like the one containing this very text!).\n",
