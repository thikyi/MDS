    "### Goals for this Assignment ###\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you have completed this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `try` and `except` to catch exceptions\n",
    "- Use `finally` to ensure that some execution will always happen around an exception\n",
    "- Define your own exceptions by inheriting from the `Exception` class\n",
    "- Throw your own exceptions using `raise`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Recover from `int` Reading a Non-Integer ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Errors in Code ###\n",
    "\n",
    "As a program executes, it's a somewhat common occurrence for things to go wrong.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When reading an integer from the user, we discover that the input is not a valid integer\n",
    "- When opening a file for reading, we discover that the file does not exist\n",
    "- When performing division, we find that the divisor is zero\n",
    "- When writing to a file, the disk runs out of space\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing these sorts of actions, we can't just ignore these scenarios.\n",
    "As such, we somehow need to indicate when these sort of problematic conditions occur.\n",
    "One way to indicate this is to have related functions return special values, or _sentinel_ values, to indicate that something went wrong.\n",
    "For example, for division, Python could have been designed so that if you attempted:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 6 / 2\n",
    "y = 5 / 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...then `x` would be `3.0` (where division was successful and the result was stored in `x`), but `y` would be `None` (a special value indicating that division was unsuccessful).\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy for indicating issues does work, and it's commonly-used in some languages, most notably C.\n",
    "However, it has a major problem: strictly speaking, we must always check if something went awry, even though it is expected that _usually_ it won't.\n",
    "For example, say we intend to compute the sum of `x` and `y` in the above snippet.\n",
    "Since `/` is not guaranteed to succeed (and returns `None` on failure), before we use `x` and `y`, we need to ensure that they don't hold `None`.\n",
    "This means we'd need to do something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 6 / 2\n",
    "if x != None:\n",
    "    y = 5 / 0\n",
    "    if y != None:\n",
    "        print(x + y)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"y's initialization lead to division by zero\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x's initialization lead to division by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we suddenly need a `if`/`else` to check if an error happened whenever we perform division.\n",
    "This code is clearly much more bloated than:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 6 / 2\n",
    "y = 5 / 0\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality is unfortunately even worse than this.\n",
    "For example, say we encapsulate this code in a separate function, and instead make the individual numbers parameters to that function, as shown below in the `compute_sum_with_division` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def compute_sum_with_division(a, b, c, d):\n",
    "    x = a / b\n",
    "    if x != None:\n",
    "        y = c / d\n",
    "        if y != None:\n",
    "            return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "    # will only reach this point if either of the divisions returned None\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a division by zero attempt is discovered within the `compute_sum_with_division` function, then this will ultimately return `None`.\n",
    "This means that anything that calls `compute_sum_with_division` will _also_ need to check that the result from this is not `None`, even though the callers themselves don't attempt this operation.\n",
    "This means that callers may need to propagate out the information that `compute_sum_with_division` returned `None` (or more specifically, _somewhere_ a division by zero was attempted).\n",
    "This very quickly leads to situations where almost any function call can lead to potentially erroneous situations happening, requiring the sort of error-handling code seen in `compute_sum_with_division` to be propagated widely through the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper C code _will_ do this sort of propagation, but it's very common for programmers to optimistically assume that such situations will not happen.\n",
    "It doesn't help that usually (but not always), such situations won't happen, so C programmers can _mostly_ get away with this.\n",
    "However, if the program hits just the wrong input, such optimism can lead to very bizarre code behavior in C, usually requiring long debugging sessions to figure out not only where the error happened, but to refactor code to properly handle such errors.\n",
    "In an ideal world, we would like something better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Exceptions and Exception Handling ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter _exceptions_.\n",
    "The insight with exceptions is that usually there is some chunk of code _somewhere_ which properly handles the error.\n",
    "However, with C, most of the error-related code merely propagates the information around that an error happened.\n",
    "With exceptions, the idea is to just immediately jump to that error-handling code, without dealing with all the sort of propagation (or at least, make it so the programmer doesn't have to deal with this propagation).\n",
    "This means exceptions allow you to write the optimistic code, like the original:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 6 / 2\n",
    "y = 5 / 0\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if a division by zero occurs, we will jump right to some code handling the error, which will be elsewhere.\n",
    "This means we can write code that _mostly_ ignores errors, but still perform error-handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been seeing exceptions for awhile in this course, though they haven't been explained until now.\n",
    "To show this, let's revisit the `int` function, which is used to convert some input to an integer representation.\n",
    "When `int` is provided a string encoding an integer, then `int` can convert that string to an integer, as with:"

    "After the `try`, at the same indent level as the `try`, we can then define one or more `except`s.\n",
    "Each `except` specifies the name of an exception, and each `except` has its own separate body.\n",

    "- The `int(\"foo\")` expression is executed, which throws a `ValueError` exception.\n",
    "- Python sees a `ValueError` exception has been thrown, but it's within a `try`.  Python sees that we had a particular `except` for `ValueError` exceptions established, and so execution jumps to the body of the specific `except` for `ValueError` exceptions.\n",
    "- Once the body of the `except` is evaluated, execution moves to the end of the whole `try`/`except`, bringing us to the next (and final) statement: `print(\"after try\")`\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps most importantly, the only times we need to use `try`/`except` in Python is when we establish the code to handle an exception.\n",
    "If all we want to do is propagate an exception, we don't need to do anything at all.\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's revisit the `compute_sum_with_division` function from before.\n",
    "Let's say division by zero now throws an exception, as opposed to returning the sentinel value `None` (and in fact, Python does throw a `ZeroDivisionError` exception if division by zero is attempted).\n",

    "If, however, `a / b` does **not** trigger division by zero, then execution will proceed forward as normal.\n",
    "The same logic applies for the later `c / d` expression.\n",
    "This means that code using exceptions can largely ignore the fact that they exist at all, except at the precise moments when we want to handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with all this in mind, what exactly is an exception itself?\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are just objects, specifically objects inheriting from the `Exception` class.\n",

    "Sometimes you need to guarantee that some bit of code gets executed _even if_ an exception is thrown, even if you don't have a handler defined for an exception.\n",

    "3. Be closed\n",

    "Without it, the file you \"wrote\" to might appear to be fine, or it may only contain part of what you wrote, become somehow corrupted, or perhaps not even appear at all.\n",
