    "- Fancy indexing can be more convenient and compact for performing certain operations, particularly those that do require us to manipulate multiple elements of an array.  Depending on the task at hand, it can be possible to avoid loops entirely, and instead combine fancy indexing with some operations we will see in later assignments.\n",
    "- Instead of hard-coding the indices to access, we can instead provide an expression evaluating to these indices.  This allows us to write an expression which computes indices that we wish to access as the program runs, which is overall very flexible.\n",
    "- In terms of performance, if we are accessing a large number of array elements, doing so with one use of fancy indexing will almost assurredly perform better than doing so with a Python loop.  With fancy indexing, most of the work is done in NumPy, and NumPy itself calls out to C to do most of its work.  C is generally much faster than Python, meaning going through NumPy (and transitively C) will very likely be much faster than doing everything directly in Python.\n",
