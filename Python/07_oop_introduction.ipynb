    "# Assignment 7: Object-Oriented Programming Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for this Assignment ###\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you have completed this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write out diagrams representing memory representation\n",
    "- Define your own classes in Python using `class`\n",
    "- Define contructors via `def __init__`\n",
    "- Define your own methods operating on objects\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Write Out Memory Representation Diagrams ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Memory Representation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've worked with a variety of data types, e.g., `int` (integers like `123`), `float` (floating-point numbers like `3.14`), `str` (strings like \"foo\"), and `bool` (Booleans like `True`).\n",
    "The values behind these data types need to be saved somewhere as execution proceeds.\n",
    "For example, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 7\n",
    "y = \"some string\"\n",
    "z = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...the data representing `7`, `\"some string\"`, and `False` needs to exist somewhere.\n",
    "As humans, we can see the values on the screen, but computers will save this information to _memory_ (or RAM).\n",
    "In order to understand how our programs actually execute (and more importantly, to better understand how to debug them when things go wrong), it's necessary to understand exactly how values are represented in memory, at least from a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface, with respect to the above Python snippet, it's tempting to say that `7`, `\"some string\"`, and `False` (hereafter referred to as \"the values\") are stored in the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively.\n",
    "Colloquially, programmers will often say this, myself included.\n",
    "In some languages, this is even true.\n",
    "However, for Python, it's a bit of an oversimplification to say that `x`, `y`, and `z` hold the values, and the distinction can lead to incorrect code if you're not careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, `x`, `y`, and `z` don't hold the values themselves, but rather _references_ to the values.\n",
    "The values themselves are represented with _objects_.\n",
    "So what are objects and references?\n",
    "To understand this, I'll use an analogy.\n",
    "Objects are analogous to houses, in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They exist somewhere.\n",
    "- They can anywhere from very small to very big, with everything in between.\n",
    "- Even a small one is not something that you can easily just hand to someone; most houses are physically too large to do this with, and would at least require a lot of work to make it possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data itself is a house in this analogy.\n",
    "Looking at the values again, you may notice that the size of these values depends a lot on the values themselves.\n",
    "For example, the integer `3` is much smaller than the integer `749072645546785347862390874690`, so it's reasonable to assume that the latter integer would take up more space (i.e., it's a bigger house).\n",
    "This is particularly pronounced for strings; the smallest string is the empty string (`\"\"`), but strings can be of any length, ranging from `\"foo\"`, `\"this is a string\"`, `\"This is a complete sentence represented via a string.\"`, all the way up to the entire contents of the Mandarin Chinese dictionary (assuming you have sufficient memory available).\n",
    "The point being: the size of an object can vary widely, depending on what exactly its representing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the size of objects can vary so much, it's often undesiable to move them around unless it's absolutely necessary to do so.\n",
    "While we _can_ move memory around and copy it, and on a human scale this will be lightning fast, on a computer scale it's abysmally slow.\n",
    "We don't want to move these objects around unless we absolutely have to.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we need some way to easily (and routinely) access these objects and manipulate them, and ideally it should be very fast (even on a computing scale) to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analogy, the solution to this problem is to introduce addresses for these houses.\n",
    "Addresses have the following desirable properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given an address, you can determine exactly where a given house is, and therefore access the house.\n",
    "- Addresses are fairly small, especially when compared to the houses they address.  You can generally write an address on a scrap of paper.\n",
    "- The size of the address is unrelated to the size of the house it addresses.  The house may be big or small, but addresses are all roughly the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addresses thus give you a way to refer to a house, without actually doing anything to the house itself.\n",
    "And unlike houses, addresses are easy to work with directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our addresses in this analogy are represented by references in Python, where references effectively hold an arrow pointing to some object in memory.\n",
    "Going back to the original Python snippet, it's true that `x`, `y`, and `z` are in memory.\n",
    "However, `x`, `y`, and `z` hold _references_, not objects.\n",
    "The specific references they hold refer elsewhere in memory, specifically to the underlying values for `7`, `\"some string\"`, and `False`.\n",
    "This is shown diagramatically below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diag1](diag1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So what about the `int`, `str`, and `bool` appearing in the above diagram?\n",
    "That information refers to the _class_ which the object is a member of.\n",
    "A class is effectively a sort of template for making objects, and objects themselves store which class made them.\n",
    "This is how Python knows what an object is.\n",
    "For example, Python knows that `1 + 2` and `\"foo\" + \"bar\"` should be treated differently (specifically with integer addition and string concatenation, respectively), ultimately because it knows the classes which made the underlying objects involved.\n",
    "Python can look at the specific classes involved, and perform a different actual operation based on this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the distinction between objects and references in mind, we can now talk about what happens on a function call when actual parameters are passed.\n",
    "Python uses _call-by-value_ semantics, meaning the variable gets a copy of whatever is passed in.\n",
    "For example, consider the code in the following cell:"

    "## Step 2: Define your Own Class ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Class Definition ###\n",
    "\n",
    "A class roughly corresponds to one kind of data.\n",
    "It is often the case where programs manipulate many kinds of data, and most kinds of data don't map nicely to Python's existing classes.\n",
    "For example, say we wanted to represent a point in a three-dimensional plane, where a point would have an `x`, `y`, and `z` axis.\n",
    "While `int` or `float` may be used for an individual axis, we would need three of them to represent the entire point.\n",
    "This is doable; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_axis = 2\n",
    "y_axis = 1\n",
    "z_axis = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, starts to get annoying quickly if we start to represent multiple points.\n",
    "For example, in this style, to represent two three-dimensional points, we'd have to have six variables in total, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_axis_1 = 2\n",
    "y_axis_2 = 1\n",
    "z_axis_3 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "x_axis_2 = 8\n",
    "y_axis_2 = 9\n",
    "z_axis_2 = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that two three-dimensional points need to allocate six integers in total is fairly unavoidable, but the way we are representing this right now is nonetheless not ideal.\n",
    "We need to remember that each triplet of variables corresponds to the same point, which introduces room for error.\n",
    "Similarly, if you want to define a function that takes a point, that function automatically needs to take _three_ parameters, since you need three integers to represent a point.\n",
    "This quickly gets inconvenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want here is some way to bundle these three integers into a single unit, where that unit represents a point.\n",
    "Good news: Python (and practically all programming languages) allows us to do this.\n",
    "In Python, this can be done by introducing our own custom class, using the `class` reserved word.\n",
    "That is, in addition to the built-in classes that Python provides, Python also allows you to define your own classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is most easily shown by example.\n",
    "The code in the next cell rewrites the prior point definition using classes."

    "A line-by-line breakdown of this code follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `class Point` says we are introducing a new class.  Classes can contain a body (and in practice, often a large body), and so this introduces a new indent level.\n",
    "- `def __init__(self, a, b, c)` defines a _constructor_ for the class.  This works a lot like a function (and it even uses `def`), but the name must _always_ be `__init__`.  Constructors are executed to create objects of the class type, or more precisely, to make _instances_ of the class.  That is, you can think of a class as a template for individual objects.  The first parameter of `__init__` should always be `self`, which refers to an instance of the object being constructed.  `a`, `b`, and `c` in this line are additional parameters to the constructor, and these work the same as normal function parameters.\n",
    "- With `self.x = a`, let's break this down into some subsequent parts:\n",
    "    - `self`: this again refers to the object being constructed.  When the constructor is called (and we will get to the call to the constructor in a bit), Python will automatically create a new empty object.\n",
    "    - `self.x`: this is a reference to the `x` _field_ on the object.  Fields work very similarly to variables; they have the same naming scheme, and like variables, fields hold references to other objects.  However, unlike variables, fields exist directly on an object, as opposed to sort of floating in some other space.\n",
    "    - `self.x =`: this is assigning to the `self.x` field of the newly-created object.  Initially, the newly-created object will have no fields on it.  In Python, if we try to assign to a field that doesn't exist, Python will automatically create the field for us.  Putting all this together, this means we are adding a `x` field to the newly-created object.\n",
    "    - `self.x = a`: From the prior bullet, we were putting an `x` field on the newly-created object.  What the full line does is create a new `x` field, and then initialize that field to whatever the `a` variable holds.\n",
    "    - In summary, this line adds an `x` field to the newly-created object, and initializes this `x` field to hold the same value as `a`.\n",
    "- `self.y = b`: Similar reasoning as `self.x = a`.  This adds a `y` field to the newly-created object, and initializes this field to hold whatever the value of `b` is.\n",
    "- `self.z = c`: Similar reasoning as `self.x = a`.  This adds a `z` field to the newly-created object, and initializes this field to hold whatever the value of `c` is.\n",
    "- `point1 = Point(2, 1, 5)`: specifically with the `Point(2, 1, 5)` part, this indirectly calls `__init__` in the `Point` class, passing a reference to `2` for `a`, a reference to `1` for `b`, and a reference to `5` for `c`.  A new `Point` object is allocated internally, and bound to `self` inside of `Point`'s `__init__`.  A reference to this new `Point` object is indirectly returned, so `point1` will hold a reference to this new `Point` object.\n",
    "- `point2 = Point(8, 9, 3)`: similar to the prior bullet, this makes another instance of the `Point` class (i.e., it allocates a new `Point` object), and calls `__init__` on `Point`.  This call ends up passing `8`, `9`, and `3` for `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.  A reference to the newly-created `Point` object is returned, and `point2` will hold a reference to this newly-created `Point` object.\n",

    "In memory, the above code with `Point` looks something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![diag3](diag3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each `Point` object has separate fields for `x`, `y`, and `z`, and those fields themselves hold references to other objects (namely `int` objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above definitions, we can now access individual fields from these `Point` objects as shown in the next cell.\n",
    "Note that you'll need to run the prior cell to ensure that the `Point` class is defined, and that `point1` and `point2` are initialized."

    "- `add_y`: which takes an amount to add to the `y` coordinate, and will modify the object's field to update `y`\n",
    "- `distance`: which takes _another_ `Point2D` object, and computes the distance between them.  Note that this requires square root, which requires an `import` in Python to make `math.sqrt` available.  We will properly cover `import` later, but for now, you only need to know that `math.sqrt` is used to compute the square root of its input."
