    "### Goals for this Assignment ###\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you have completed this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `with` and `open` to open files for reading or writing\n",
    "- Use `for...in` with a file to read files line-by-line\n",
    "- Use `str`'s `rstrip` method to remove whitespace on the righthand side of a string\n",
    "- Use the `write` method to write something to a file\n",

    "### Background: Opening Files and Reading Lines from a File ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs very commonly work with files.\n",
    "For example, Jupyter notebook itself works with `.ipynb` files.\n",
    "Specifically, Jupyter will open a `.ipynb` file, read its contents, and use this information to display cells to the programmer.\n",
    "These cells will possibly be pre-populated with text or code, like the text you're reading right now.\n",
    "The contents of the `.ipynb` file itself were created by Jupyter notebook; specifically, I created the cells, wrote contents in them, and then told Jupyter notebook to save all this information as a `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "The contents of the `.ipynb` file is in a _format_ which is recognized by Jupyter notebook; a format is really just a way of saying that we agree that certain information is represented a certain way, and so we will interpret information according to whatever that format is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll write programs which directly work with files, separate from the `.ipynb` files used by Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "The actual format used will be simplistic: the file will represent a list of numbers, where each number is represented with a bunch of text digits.\n",
    "The numbers will be separated by newlines; i.e., each number will be on its own line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can read from or write to a file, we must first open the file.\n",
    "In Python, this is accomplished with `with open`.\n",
    "(A later assignment will go into the `with` part in more detail; right now you don't need to worry about all the details behind `with`.)\n",
    "When opening the file, we need to tell Python the name of the file we are trying to open, as well as whether or not we are trying to open it for reading or writing.\n",
    "For this first part, we will focus only on reading from files.\n",
    "From there, Python may fail to open the file.\n",
    "For example, if we request to open a file for reading which does not exist, then there is nothing to read from, and therefore we would get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, the file does exist and we can successfully open it, this creates a _file handle_.\n",
    "A file handle is a representation of an open file, and allows for subsequent read or write operations.\n",
    "This is where the name comes from - you can think of this as a handle on a file, much like a handle on a cooking pot.\n",
    "In Python, a file handle is specifically represented with an object, and there are a variety of methods available on the file handle.\n",
    "[This link to the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) provides more details about what file handle objects can do and what methods they provide, but for here we will only focus on the bare essentials (and incidentally the most commonly-used operations).\n",
    "Once we have a file handle open for reading, we can use a `for...in` loop to read the file line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of this together, the following code snippet reads the file `numbers.txt`, and prints out the contents of `numbers.txt`, line-by-line.\n",
    "`numbers.txt` is included with this assignment on Canvas, and will need to be downloaded from there and put into the same directory as the corresponding `.ipynb` file."
