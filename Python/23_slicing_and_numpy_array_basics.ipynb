    "As shown, the code above ends up putting all elements after the second element into the list `rest`.\n",
    "This demonstrates that destructuring can be used to isolate different parts of a list into a separate list.\n",
    "\n",
    "That all said, destructuring is limited in its capacity to do this sort of isolation.\n",
    "Say instead we want to define a `product_n_then_sum` function, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes a list of numbers\n",
    "- Takes some non-negative number `n`\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these parameters, `product_n_then_sum` should find the product of the first `n` elements, and then add this product to the sum of the remaining list elements.\n",
    "To be clear, the `product_n_then_sum` function is a generalization of the `product_then_sum` function, where the number of elements to get the product of is now a parameter, whereas this number is hard-coded to `2` for `product_then_sum`.\n",
    "Phrased a different way, given `product_n_then_sum`, we could trivially implement `product_then_sum` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def product_then_sum(input_list):\n",
    "    return product_n_then_sum(input_list, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This generalization with `product_n_then_sum` is problematic with destructuring, because destructuring requires us to know ahead of time exactly how many elements we want to extract in this manner.\n",
    "For example, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, *rest = some_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...the code's structure itself tells us we are bunching all the list elements from index `2` onwards into `rest`, as we destructure `a` and `b` first.\n",
    "Similarly, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x, y, z, *rest = some_other_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...this shows we are cutting out the first three list elements (into `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively), and grouping everything else into `rest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, because the number of list elements we extract here is determined by how many variables and commas we provide, this is not suitable for situations where we don't know how many elements we want at the moment when we write the code.\n",
    "Or, phrased another way, while we _can_ write out `n` variables and commas for any `n`, we need to know the specific value of `n` to do so.\n",
    "However, the whole point of parameterizing `n` with `product_n_then_sum` is that this `n` is no longer fixed, so destructuring won't work for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this issue is by introducing a `while` loop and manually working through the list indices.\n",
    "However, there is another Python feature we have yet to see which can be of assistance here: _slicing_.\n",
    "The idea with slicing is that we can create a copy of a list, wherein we specify ranges of indices to copy over into the new list.\n",
    "This can be done with square brackets (`[]`) and colon `:`.\n",
    "An example is shown in the next cell, which implements a version of `product_n_then_sum`:"

    "- You have more fine-grained control over the size (in memory) of the array elements, and how they are represented.  For example, you can select the number of bits which will be used for integers, and whether or not they can be negative.  In contrast, normal Python integers are arbitrary precision (meaning they can take up an arbitrarily large amount of memory for a big enough integer), and can always be negative.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays tend to make matrix-level operations easy, or at least easier than with lists.\n",
    "- (Perhaps most importantly) many common operations, particularly arithmetic operations, are **much** faster with NumPy arrays, with performance improvements typically in the 2x - 100x faster range, commonly with values in the 50x range.  This is because NumPy takes advantage of special hardware available on most platforms (specifically [vector operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor)).  Even typical C/C++ programs don't use this hardware (though they can).  Given that data sets are commonly very large, and pure Python is not particularly good for performance, NumPy offers a good solution here.\n",

    "The following is a line-by-line explanation of this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import numpy as np`: loads in the NumPy library and makes it accessible.  By convention, the NumPy library should be imported as `np`, as performed in this line.\n",
    "2. `example_array = np.array([8, 3, 4, 5])`: creates a new NumPy array, holding the values `8`, `3`, `4`, and `5`, in that order.  The array is then bound to the new variable `example_array`.  The type of the array elements is automatically determined by NumPy (more on that in a bit).\n",
    "3. `print(example_array[0])`, followed by all the `print`s grouped in the same block: prints out the values in `example_array` at non-negative indices.  As shown, NumPy arrays can be accessed via non-negative indices in the same manner as Python lists.\n",
    "4. `print(example_array[-1])`, followed by all the `print`s grouped in the same block: prints out the values in `example_array` at negative indices.  These behave the same as with negative indices in Python arrays.\n",
    "5. `print(example_array.dtype)`: prints the type of the array elements.  In this case, this prints `int64`, meaning each array element is represented as a _signed 64-bit_ integer.  By \"signed\", we mean the value could be negative.  By 64-bit, we mean each integer occupies 64 bits (64 zeros or ones) in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `array` function is used, the type of the array elements is automatically determined based on the actual elements passed.\n",
    "In this case, NumPy picked a much larger type than strictly necessary.\n",
    "To understand why, the largest value in the array, `8`, can be represented with 4 bits; exactly why this is is beyond our scope.\n",
    "Additionally, our input list does not contain any negative values, and therefore we don't need a representation capable of storing negative values; we can instead pick an _unsigned_ representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to control the type of the array elements, we can pass the `dtype` keyword parameter when creating the array, like so:"
