    "- Define constructors which call the parent class' constructor\n",

    "At this point, you are used to calling methods on objects, and even defining your own methods on objects.\n",
    "There is a bit of functionality here which effectively comes for free in Python, which is easy to overlook.\n",
    "Specifically, when you call a method in Python, Python only checks if the given object has a given method with the same name and correct number of arguments.\n",
    "Python doesn't check anything deeper.\n",
    "Because of this, you can substitute in different objects as the target of the call, as long as all the objects share a method with the same name and number of parameters.\n",

    "Importantly, in the `print_area_perimeter` function, the underlying type of `shape` is actually different for the two different calls later in the code.\n",
    "In the first call, `shape` is of type `Circle`, but in the second call, `shape` is of type `Square`.\n",
    "Despite the fact that the type of `shape` is different, and despite the fact that `print_area_perimeter` calls methods on the given shape, this code works problem-free.\n",
    "This is because both `Circle` and `Square` define the `area` and `perimeter` methods, which each take no arguments.\n",
    "This is the only real _contract_ (meaning, software expectations) that `print_area_perimeter` puts on `shape`: the `shape` needs to define these `area` and `perimeter` methods, and if so, then `print_area_perimeter` will work correctly, no matter the underlying type of `shape`.\n",
    "This ability to substitute types is often referred to as _polymorphism_, which comes from a Greek word meaning _many forms_.\n",
    "That is, the underlying object can have different types.\n",
    "This ability is also sometimes called _duck typing_, which is from the adage that if \"something looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is probably a duck\".\n",

    "> Slight pedantic aside/rant, which can be completely skipped: this is specifically exhibiting _ad-hoc polymorphism_, which means that the actual choice of method called can be delayed until runtime.\n",
    "> The term \"polymorphism\" by itself is not well-defined, as there are other kinds of polymorphism which are unrelated to how this code works, such as subtyping polymorphism, parametric polymorphism, and row polymorphism.\n",
    "> All of these different kinds of polymorphism share the property of allowing you to reuse code for different kinds of things, but the particularities are wildly different.\n",
    "> However, outside of programming language design, this is generally not well-understood, and people commonly use the term \"polymorphism\" to refer to both ad-hoc polymorphism and subtyping polymorphism.\n",
    "> While we will discuss subclasses, we will not discuss subtyping polymorphism, because strictly speaking, Python doesn't have it, as it is subsumed by Python's dynamic typing.\n",
    "> Furthermore, the term \"duck typing\" is also not particularly well-defined once you get into all the details, so I'll be avoiding the term.\n",
    "> I will use the unqualified term \"polymorphism\" from this point forward, as this is consistent with how this information is usually presented on the Internet or in textbooks.\n",
    "\n",
