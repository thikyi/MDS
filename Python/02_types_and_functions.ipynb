    "# Assignment 2: Types and Calling Functions #\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for this Assignment ###\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you have completed this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the type of expressions involving integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and strings (`str`)\n",
    "- Understand what calls to the built-in functions `int`, `float`, and `str` do, and identify the types of expressions calls to these functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Print out the Types of Some Python Expressions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on Types ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are snippets of code which evaluate down to a given value.\n",
    "For example, `1`, `1 + 2`, and `\"foo\"` are expressions which evaluate to `1`, `3`, and `\"foo\"`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "All values have a _type_, where the type describes what kind of value it is.\n",
    "For example, expressions `1`, `1 + 2`, and `3 * 4` are all of type integer.\n",
    "Type integer is referred to as `int` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an expression evalutes down to a floating-point number, the expression is of type `float`.\n",
    "For example, `3.14`, `1.2 + 8.4`, and `8.3 * 9.2` are all of type `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an expression evaluates down to a string, the expression is of type `str`.\n",
    "For example, `\"blah\"` is of type `str`.\n",
    "Strings can be _concatenated_, allowing for two strings to be stitched together to form a new string.\n",
    "Concatenation is done with `+`.\n",
    "For example, `\"foo\" + \"bar\"` evaluates down to the value `\"foobar\"`.\n",
    "Therefore, the type of `\"foo\" + \"bar\"` is string (or `str` in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `+` is used for integers, floats, and strings.\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int + int` evaluates to `int` (e.g., `1 + 2` evaluates to the integer `3`)\n",
    "- `float + float` evaluates to `float` (e.g., `2.2 + 3.2` evaluates to the float `5.4`)\n",
    "- `str + str` evaluates to `str` (e.g., `\"apple\" + \"pear\"` evaluates to the `str` `\"applepear\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, the type of an expression using `+` depends on the types of the _operands_ to `+`, i.e., the types of what you are adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "`+` even works for some intermixed types.\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int + float` evaluates to `float` (e.g., `1 + 1.2` evaluates to the float `2.2`)\n",
    "- `float + int` evaluates to `float` (e.g., `1.2 + 1` evaluates to the float `2.2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, you cannot combine strings and integers (or floats) with `+`; this will give you an error.\n",
    "For example, if you attempt to do `\"foo\" + 1`, this results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<python-input-14>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "    \"foo\" + 1\n",
    "    ~~~~~~^~~\n",
    "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Print Types of Expressions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell evaluates a number of expressions, and prints out their values.\n",
    "For each `print`ing of an expression, the type of the expression should be printed out on the next line.\n",
    "Complete the `print`s so that the type of each expression is printed out afterwards.\n",
    "The first three `print`s have been completed for you."

    "## Step 2: Print out the Types of Python Expressions Using `int`, `float`, and `str` ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Functions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has support for _functions_, which behave much the same as functions in mathematics.\n",
    "Functions allow you to define some bit of code which can be _called_ in multiple places (i.e., executed).\n",
    "Functions can take _parameters_ as input, and generally produce some sort of output.\n",
    "The output of a given function usually depends (a lot) on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly in the course we will get into defining our own functions, but for now we will work with some functions that Python provides for us.\n",
    "We have already been using a function, namely `print`, in order to print values to the user.\n",
    "Here we introduce three new functions, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`, which takes some input, and will attempt to convert it to an integer.\n",
    "    - Integers will be passed through directly.  For example, `int(3)` will evaluate to `3` (type `int`)\n",
    "    - Floats will be _truncated_, i.e., the part with the `.` and onwards will be chopped off.  For example, `int(3.5)` evaluates to `3` (type `int`).\n",
    "    - Strings will be read and attempted to be interpreted as an integer.  For example, `int(\"123\")` evaluates to `123` (type `int`).  Not all strings can be successfully converted, and an error will result if the string cannot be converted.  For example, `int(\"hello\")` results in an error.\n",
    "- `float`, which takes some input and will attempt to convert it to a float.  It works the same as `int`, only the result will be of type `float`.  Like the `int` function, if given a string that does not represent a floating-point number, then an error will result.\n",
    "- `str`, which takes some input and converts it to a string representation.\n",
    "    - Integers get a string representation, e.g., `str(2)` evaluates to \"2\" (type `str`)\n",
    "    - Floats get a string representation, e.g., `str(3.14)` evaluates to \"3.14\" (type `str`)\n",
    "    - Strings are passed through directly, e.g., `str(\"foo\")` evaluates to `\"foo\"` (type `str`)\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, while the `int`, `float`, and `str` functions are intended to produce values with types of the same names.\n",
    "These functions themselves aren't the types, but have the same names as the corresponding types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Print Types of Expressions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the prior step, the next cell evaluates a number of expressions, and prints out their values.\n",
    "However, these expressions all involve the `int`, `float`, or `str` functions.\n",
    "For each `print`ing of an expression, the type of the expression should be printed out on the next line.\n",
    "Complete the `print`s so that the type of each expression is printed out afterwards.\n",
    "The first three have been completed for you."
