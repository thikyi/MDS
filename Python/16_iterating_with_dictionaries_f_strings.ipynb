    "This step doesn't introduce anything new, but rather has you put together knowledge that you have so far to accomplish a larger task.\n",
    "It is often the case that we want to know how frequently a given value appears in an input data set.\n",
    "For example, with the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...we can see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1` appears two times\n",
    "- `2` appears three times\n",
    "- `3` appears one time\n",
    "- `4` appears one time\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, you need to define a function named `print_frequencies`, which will print out how frequently each number appears in an input list.\n",
    "`print_frequencies` should print out the numbers in _sorted_ order, just as the prior example put the bullet points in order sorted by the numbers in the list.\n",
    "Example expected output is provided in the comments in the next cell; leave these in place in order to test your `print_frequencies` definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a fair warning, `print_frequencies` will require you to put skills you've learned from multiple assignments together.\n",
    "There is more than one correct solution, by a long shot.\n",
    "Some hints follow, which may be useful for your implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dictionary can be used internally to track the numbers you see in the input list, where the keys are the numbers themselves.  The values in this dictionary can track how many times you've seen a particular value.\n",
    "- You likely will need to use `if` to see if you've seen a given number before or not.\n",
    "- You likely will need to update the dictionary as you go through the list, at least to update how many times you have seen a given number.\n",
    "- You likely will need to make use of `sorted` in order to put the numbers in their final sorted order for printing\n",
    "- F-strings will likely simplify printing"
