    "By the time you have completed this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code which defines variables\n",
    "- Write code using Boolean expressions\n",
    "- Compare integers using `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`\n",
    "- Chain larger Boolean expressions from smaller ones by using `not`, `and`, and `or`\n",

    "### Background: Variables ###\n",
    "\n",
    "As in mathematics, variables are basically a named bucket which can hold some particular variable.\n",
    "You've already seen variables in Python, specifically with the formal parameters of functions.\n",
    "For example, in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def identity(x):\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...`x` is a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, you do not need to introduce a function in order to introduce a variable in Python.\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to have a variable named `foo` with value `12` available, you could do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "foo = 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that line of code, any access to `foo` will give back the value `12`.\n",
    "You can see this if you run the following cell, which should print `12`:"

    "Introducing variables helps us to break larger problems down into smaller ones, and can give those subproblems distinct names, too.\n",
    "For example, say you wanted the sum of the areas of three different rectangles, with widths `width1`, `width2`, and `width3`, and lengths `length1`, `length2`, and `length3`.\n",
    "You could compute this all with one big formula, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "area_sum = width1 * length1 + width2 * length2 + width3 * length3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, starts to get a little repetitive, and it can get long enough where you lose track of the bigger picture.\n",
    "(As testament to this, I originally wrote this with one of the `*` operations as a `+` operation, and didn't catch it until later.)\n",
    "We can alternatively write the above formula as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "area1 = width1 * length1\n",
    "area2 = width2 * length2\n",
    "area3 = width3 * length3\n",
    "area_sum = area1 + area2 + area3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems, as well as the ability to give those subproblems meaningful names, can help with both reading and writing code.\n",
    "Additionally, sometimes the result of a particular subproblem is needed multiple times, and this way we can avoid recomputing it.\n",
    "For example, the following formula, as written, would compute `a * b` _twice_ if it were written in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a * b + a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...however, we can rewrite this formula in Python to something more like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temp = a * b\n",
    "temp + temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...which would only compute `a * b` once.\n",
    "We then use the variable `temp` multiple times, and temp holds the result of `a * b`.\n",
    "Using variables to avoid recomputation will always result in a performance savings, and can be a significant savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Variable Scoping ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic programs contain many variables.\n",
    "To put this in perspective, in a project I recently worked on, one file was a little under 200 lines of code, but nonetheless it declared 121 variables.\n",
    "This was admittedly in a different language (Scala), but the point being that on average, variables were introduced a little more frequently than once per every other line.\n",
    "With so many variables in play, this can quickly become overwhelming without some sort of way to manage these.\n",
    "In particular, it can be easy to forget which variable names you have already introduced.\n",
    "This can be a disaster if you happen to reuse a name without realizing it, because this could mean that you end up redefining what some part of your code means with something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, programming languages (including Python) support _variable scoping_, which controls when and where variables can be accessed.\n",
    "For functions, formal parameters are said to be _in scope_ only within the body of the function itself.\n",
    "For example, consider the code in the next cell:"

    "### Background: Variable Naming ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can have almost any name, as long as it does not contain spaces.\n",
    "However, we often want to use multiple words to describe what a variable does, and usually the best variable names are self-descriptive.\n",
    "To allow for multiple words to go into a variable name, there are two commonly-used naming styles: snake case and camel case.\n",
    "With snake case naming, underscores are used to separate the different words in a variable name.\n",
    "For example, `this_is_one_variable`.\n",
    "With camel case, you instead use capitalization between different words.\n",
    "For example, `thisIsOneVariable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python itself doesn't care which style you use.\n",
    "However, the Python community as a whole strongly prefers that variable names and function names use snake case, whereas class names (which we will get into later) use camel case.\n",
    "While this may not sound like a big deal, following community standards helps a lot with code readability.\n",
    "For example, with `ThisIsAName`, because this is written in camel case, a Python programmer would be safe to assume that this represents a class name, without knowing anything else about your program.\n",
    "Similarly, with `this_is_a_name`, the programmer is safe to assume that this is a variable or function name.\n",
    "If, however, you don't follow these community standards, this makes it harder to understand code; you now need to look at the specific context in which a name is used to make sense of it, which requires stictly more time and information, and is more error-prone.\n",
