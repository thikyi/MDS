    "By the time you have completed this assignment, you should be able to:\n",

    "- Create dictionaries in Python using `{...}`\n",
    "- Access elements in a dictionary using `[...]`\n",
    "- Add elements to a dictionary using `[...]`\n",
    "- Check if a dictionary contains an element using `in`\n",
    "- Check if a dictionary does **not** contain an element using `not in`\n",
    "- Get the number of elements in a dictionary using the `len` function\n",
    "- Remove elements from a dictionary using `del`\n",

    "### Background: Map Data Structures ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps are one of the most commonly-used data structures in programming, perhaps second only to lists.\n",
    "Maps are based around having a set of _keys_, where each key is associated with a given value.\n",
    "In real life, we see maps all the time.\n",
    "For example, a phone's contact list allows you to look up the phone number associated with a given name.\n",
    "Or, phrased another way, people's names are keys, and their phone numbers are values.\n",
    "As another example, a student ID number allows someone to look up information about the student with the ID number; the ID number is thus the key, and the collective information about the student is the value.\n",
    "Exactly what type the key and value are depends on the particular map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps go by a number of different names, some of which are synonymous with each other, others of which are specializations.\n",
    "You may hear any of the following terms used to refer to maps (you're not expected to memorize this, and is provided just in case you see them in the future):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hash maps\n",
    "- Hash tables\n",
    "- Hash\n",
    "- Table\n",
    "- Associative arrays\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"hash\" variants all refer to [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), which are used in the implementations of some kinds of maps.\n",
    "Exactly how hash functions can be used to implement a map is beyond our scope, but the point is that the hash functions themselves are sometimes treated as if they are synonymous with the maps.\n",
    "In some cases, people will refer to maps in general as hashes (or one of the other variants), even though maps in general don't necessarily use hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Associative arrays\" are another way to implement maps, though without hash functions.\n",
    "However, like hashes, sometimes maps in general are referred to as associative arrays, even if they don't use this specific implementation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rarely, maps are referred to as \"tables\".\n",
    "Since tables in practice often have a single column right at the beginning which is unique, this first column is effectively a key, and everything else is part of the value for the key.\n",
    "However, not all tables work this way, and not all tables are even implemented as maps, so using \"table\" unqualified would not necessarily mean a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dictionaries\" at this point are synonymous with maps, but this word's reference to maps is usually in the context of Python.\n",
    "Python has built-in support for maps, but it calls these maps \"dictionaries\".\n",
    "Given Python's popularity, the term \"dictionary\" has sometimes escaped outside of strictly Python circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Fun fact: Computer Scientists are generally very bad at naming things, and maps with this army of mostly not-quite-synonyms are, for better or worse, a great example of such naming issues.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, accessing values in a map is very efficient, even if there are a lot of entries in the dictionary.\n",
    "Whether or not this is efficient, and how efficient it is, depends on the specific way in which the dictionary is implemented.\n",
    "These implementation details are beyond our scope, but specific to Python, they are typically about as fast as you can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Dictionaries in Python ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionaries can be created using curly brackets (`{}`).\n",
    "From there, one can use square brackets (`[]`) to access values in the dictionary by their key, similar to list indexing.\n",
    "An example is shown in the cell below."

    "## Step 5: Define a Wrapper Around a Dictionary With Methods for All These Operations ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Wrappers ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the term [_wrapper_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function) is commonly used to refer to a class, function, or other unit of computation which contains some other unit of computation.\n",
    "Unlike a normal class/function/etc., a wrapper generally does very little computation of its own, and mostly just defers to whatever thing it wraps around.\n",
    "There is no hard-and-fast distinction between some normal bit of computation and a wrapper, but saying \"wrapper\" implies that most, if not all of the functionality is in the thing we wrap around.\n",
    "While this might seem wasteful (why not just use the thing directly?), sometimes there is a tiny amount of extra computation we need to do, or we need to make one sort of object fit into a place where a closely-related but nonetheless different object is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try this Yourself ###\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, you will define a wrapper class over a dictionary.\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You must define a `class` named `Map`\n",
    "- `Map` has a constructor which takes no arguments other than `self`, and will internally create a new empty dictionary.  This dictionary needs to be saved in some field.\n",
    "- `Map` has an `add` method, which is used to add a given key/value pair to the underlying dictionary.  If the dictionary already contains the key/value pair, `add` will instead update the value associated with the given key.\n",
    "- `Map` has a `get` method, which is used to get the value in the underlying dictionary associated with a given key.  It's an error for someone to call `get` without a key that actually exists in the underlying dictionary.\n",
    "- `Map` has a `contains` method, which returns a Boolean indicating whether or not a given key exists in the underlying dictionary.\n",
    "- `Map` has a `remove` method, which removes the given key (and its associated value) from the underlying dictionary.  It's an error if the underlying dictionary does not already contain the given key.\n",
    "- `Map` has a `num_items` method, which returns the number of key/value pairs in the underlying dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the next cell creates a `Map` object, and calls the above methods in various ways.\n",
    "The comments show what these various methods should return.\n",
    "Define your `Map` class in the next cell so that the code will work as intended according to the above description and comments.\n",
    "Leave the code that's currently there in place in order to test your code."
