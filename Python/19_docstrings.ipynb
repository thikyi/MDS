    "## Step 2: Define a Docstring for a Function ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Documentation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, when programming, in addition to the code you write, you also write documentation for that code.\n",
    "The documentation provides important context for whoever is reading the code, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What the bit of code is trying to do\n",
    "- What sorts of values are held in any variables involved, and what these values represent\n",
    "- (For a function) what parameters the function takes, and what these represent\n",
    "- (For a function) what is returned from a function, and what this represents\n",
    "- Any _side-effects_ of the given code.  These include things which are printed out, any I/O performed, or variables modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly what to document and how much you document is a highly subjective problem.\n",
    "From the standpoint of Python itself, documentation is irrelevant to your program's execution, and it will be ignored.\n",
    "However, programmers themselves generally expect _some_ documentation, and code with poor/no documentation is notorious for being difficult to work with.\n",
    "In practice, what and how you document will depend on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any coding conventions of the language you are working with\n",
    "- Any coding conventions of the specific project you are working on.  It's common for large projects to have _style guides_, which can formalize documentation expectations, among other things (e.g., dictating how variables be named, how much spacing to use for indents, etc.)\n",
    "- Your own particular preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "As to where the documentation lives, some of it is in the code itself, as with comments.\n",
    "However, it's not uncommon for documentation to live at least somewhat separately from the code itself.\n",
    "For example, with matplotlib, the documentation which was linked was on a website.\n",
    "However, parts of that website were automatically-generated based on documentation in the code (we will get to that shortly).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation in Relation to this Course ###\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this class, outside of this assignment, I will not require you do document anything you do.\n",
    "However, be advised that some professors _do_ expect this, some even without explicitly saying that, so it's worth asking in the future if you aren't 100% sure what the expectation is.\n",
    "If you don't document, you should be reasonably confident that your code is correct; if I see your code isn't working correctly, any documentation can help me understand your thought process (and possibly award more partial credit).\n",
    "\n",
    "My reasoning why I don't require documentation is because in my own projects, I tend to try to write [_self-documenting code_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code), wherein one carefully uses names, types, and code structure to make the code's meaning as clear as possible.\n",
    "(Whether or not I actually do this properly is another question. :) )\n",
    "Counterintuitively, I also tend to ignore large block comments when reading other people's code, which should theoretically be a rich source of documentation.\n",
    "The reason I do this is because nothing ensures that the comments actually correspond to what the code does.\n",
    "Moreover, as code evolves in a large project (i.e., bugs are fixed, features are added, etc.), nothing enforces that such large chunks of documentation get updated.\n",
    "From my own experience dealing with industry-scale codebases (specifically [the Rust language compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and the [OpenJDK for Java](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk)), I've found that programmers tend _not_ to update such documentation.\n",
    "The end result is documentation that corresponds to the code well enough that you think it applies, but is different enough to lead you down false paths.\n",
    "I've found that in such cases it's better to have no documentation at all, as opposed to documentation which is misleading at best or flat-out wrong.\n",
    "This is all a huge motivation for self-documenting code, because self-documenting code is forced to be up-to-date with what the code actually does.\n",
    "All this said, my position is quite extreme on the spectrum of documentation, so take this all with a grain of salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: (Partially) Automatically-Generated Websites from Code Documentation, and Docstrings ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are commonly-used to document code, and for good reason: comments can be put directly alongside the code they document.\n",
    "This means we can see the documentation immediately in the context of the code it is documenting.\n",
    "However, there are a couple downsides to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because comments are generally ignored by whatever executes the language, there isn't a good way for us to manipulate comments programmatically.  That is, comments are, by construction, secondary to the code itself.\n",
    "- The fact that comments are defined alongside the code is a double-edged sword.  This means that someone who wants to read the documentation **must** also read the code that it is documenting, or at least, have it on screen.  For something large like matplotlib, you probably don't want to see (and very likely will never need to see) how its functions and methods internally work.  You only need to know how to call them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, many languages support some way to write comments (or comment-like) structures in code, but with a twist: they can be automatically extracted by a separate tool, and this tool can then automatically build a website around this.\n",
    "Unlike the code itself, a website makes it easy to link related things together, to where the reader only needs to click to jump around.\n",
    "A website also allows for better formatting than code itself (which is limited to whatever your specific text editor or editing environment presents things).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is most easily shown by example.\n",
    "In the prior assignment, you used matplotlib's `scatter` method to generate scatter plots.\n",
    "In that assignment, the [official documentation for `scatter`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter.html) was linked.\n",
    "Much of that page was actually automatically-generated from [this source code](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/v3.10.6/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L4782-L5071), which is linked off of the page.\n",
    "Exactly what that code does is not important here; we will focus on _how_ this was done.\n",
    "The important part is that, on the line after the `def`, you see the start of a triple-quoted string.\n",
    "An excerpt of this is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,\n",
    "                vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None, *,\n",
    "                edgecolors=None, colorizer=None, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters\n",
    "        ----------\n",
    "        x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This triple-quoted string is not explicitly bound to any variables; it just sort of floats below the function's `def`.\n",
    "That's because in this context, it's not a normal triple-quoted string, but rather a _documentation string_ (or _docstring_, for short).\n",
    "Docstrings can be used to automatically generate the sort of documentation seen for matplotlib, and sure enough, matplotlib's documentation for `scatter` contains all the text seen in this docstring.\n",
    "However, unlike the Python code itself, the documentation for matplotlib uses formatting to make this more readable.\n",
    "Specifically, certain parts are bolded, bullets are used, and even an HTML table appears.\n",
    "Moreover, because this information is presented in a webpage, this allows someone to glance through this without opening the code, and someone reading this documentation can easily see which functions are provided by matplotlib (summarized on the lefthand side of matplotlib's documentation page).\n",
    "That is, the webpage is a much more user-friendly and explorable representation of the information in the docstring, but the docstring itself can be defined right next to the code it documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to note here is that _any_ text within the triple quotes is the docstring.\n",
    "Because this is a string, you can truly put anything in here that is a string.\n",
    "For better or for worse, there is not a single standard behind what goes in this string, or how it should be formatted within.\n",
    "There is [one particular commonly-used standard used by Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#381-docstrings), and [another one for NumPy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).\n",
    "For our purposes, we will not be following any particular guide, though you are welcome to use any formatting you want in a docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings can be attached to functions, classes, constructors, and methods.\n",
    "This is shown below in the `IntWrapper` class, which is intended to wrap around a given integer.\n",
    "This is also shown in the `add` function, which can add two integers together."
