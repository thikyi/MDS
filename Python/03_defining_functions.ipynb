    "### Background: Why Functions and Defining Functions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow us to take some chunk of code, effectively give that chunk of code a name, and then execute that code whenever we use that name.\n",
    "This allows for us to reuse some piece of code repeatedly, without needing to repeat the code itself.\n",
    "In natural languages, this is analogous to creating a new word and giving that word a definition we all agree on.\n",
    "As long as we agree on the definition, we merely need to say the word in order for the semantic meaning behind the word to be conveyed.\n",
    "Unlike words in natural languages, functions can takes values as input (known as _parameters_) and produce values as output, though we won't get into that until the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can define your own functions using the `def` reserved word.\n",
    "From there, you need to provide a name for your function, some parentheses, and a colon.\n",
    "After the colon, and code that follows on the next line **which is indented** is part of the same function.\n",
    "By indentation, this means the code is shifted over by some number of spaces (for our purposes, and in general, this should be four spaces).\n",
    "For example, the following cell defines a function named `example`, which will print `\"this is an example\"` every time `example` is called."

    "However, this lack of communication counterintuitively is usually a _very_ good thing, as realistic programs can generate trillions of intermediate values, quickly overwhelming our ability to reason through them.\n",
    "We usually only care about a very small subset of the values computed in a program, not the results of intermediate computations needed to get there, and so it makes sense to use `print` only the values we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case in point, `print` itself _abstracts_ over a lot of detail.\n",
    "Abstraction means that details behind the operation aren't needed to request that the operation be performed.\n",
    "For example, with `print(\"foo\")`, we don't say where exactly we are printing to, or what encoding the output should have; those details have been abstracted away from us.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we can call `print`, which internally must know these details.\n",
    "In fact, `print` ultimately needs to know a _lot_ of information, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What cell or terminal is the `print` being executed in?  This influences where the output should be displayed.\n",
    "- Is this `print` being executed interactively, or in batch?  If it's interactive, then this output should be displayed directly to the user.  If it's in batch, then the output will be written to a file.\n",
    "- If we are displaying directly to the user, what specific program is doing the display?  This influences how the information will be displayed.\n",
    "- If we are displaying ultimately on a monitor, what graphics card (or integrated graphics) is the system using?  Moreover, how do we communicate this information to the operating system, and how does the graphics driver handle this information?\n",
    "- If we are ultimately writing to a file, where is this being written?  How is this information communicated to the operating system?  If this file resides on disk, what device drivers are being used to interact with the underlying hardware?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only a sliver of all the things which `print` ultimately is responsible for, and is not an exaggeration; `print` is remarkably complex if you start looking at all the details.\n",
    "But importantly, _you generally don't need to worry about any of it_ in order to call `print`.\n",
    "You only need to tell `print` what you want to print, and `print` will directly (or indirectly) figure everything else out.\n",
    "The reality is that `print` itself calls out to many other functions (including functions not even defined in Python) which each abstracts over increasingly low-level information.\n",
    "The fact that we don't generally need to worry about any of this is testament to the fact that `print` has abstracted over printing very effectively.\n",
